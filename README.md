# Hi fellow coders, recruiters, curious people 👋
## Few words about me 💫
😎 I am Trang, usully goes by Chloe, currently live in Helsinki. Growing up, I have always been a visual person, and somewhere along the way, I discovered my interest in coding. But as we all know, coding can be intimidating, time-consuming, and often monotonous—not to mention, not always the most visually appealing process. So, I thought, maybe I could bring something to the table—creating programs that are not only functional but also intuitive and visually appealing. That's the plan anyway!
- 🔭  I’m currently studying at Haaga-Helia University of Applied Sciences
- 🌱  I’m currently improving my skills in JavaScript, Java, Python with a sprinkle of SQL

### In my freetime, I like to: 
 - 🏋🏻‍♂️  Throw some heavy plates around
 - 🚴🏼  Cycling around town for fun
 - 🛍️  Thrifting 
 - 🛋️  Move my furnitures around (aka typical Gemini)

### My strengths are: 
* Communications
* Eyes for Aesthetic
* Adaptability
These might not be the skills you’d usually think of for a developer, but they’re my biggest strengths and what help me stand out.
